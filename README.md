# SVG-Logo-Maker

Use a Node.js command-line app to make an SVG logo. Choose a color, shape, and text. Save as an SVG file.

## Description

This project is a Node.js command-line application that allows users to create logos and save them as SVG files. The application guides users through selecting colors and shapes, adding text to their logo, and saving the final product as an SVG file that can be used on other websites.

## Installation

Install the following packages:
• Jest: version 29.7.0
• Inquirer: version 8.2.4

## Usage

To use this app, please open the integrated terminal and enter the command "node index.js". This will prompt a series of questions to guide you through the logo generation process. Once all questions have been correctly answered, a message will appear on the command line informing you that your logo has been created. You may find your generated new logo in the "lib" folder as "logo.svg".
